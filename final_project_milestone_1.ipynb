    "**Objective:** The Project Proposal is the first milestone in your final project journey. Its purpose is to provide a clear and concise outline of the machine learning problem or application you intend to explore. This milestone sets the foundation for your final project and requires you to articulate the significance of the chosen problem, describe the dataset you plan to use, and specify the machine learning algorithms you intend to explore."

Weeds use the nutrients, water, land and many more things that might have gone to crops. Which results in less production of the required crop. The farmer often uses pesticides to remove weeds which is also effective but some pesticides may stick with crops and may cause problems for humans.\n",

    "There are a number of machine learning algorithms that we may use to solve our problem. Some potential options include: Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Random forest excels in it's ease of use and flexibility in handling classification problems. It also excels in minimizing overfitting. CNN is a type of learning algorithm that excels in computer vision, which will no doubt be useful in this type of project. Finally, we are considering using KNN, because of our previous exposure to it. Furthermore, it's proximity based classifications could be useful in differentiating between crops and weeds."
