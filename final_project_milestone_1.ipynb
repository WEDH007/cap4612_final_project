Its purpose is to provide a clear and concise outline of the machine learning problem or application you intend to explore. This milestone sets the foundation for your final project and requires you to articulate the significance of the chosen problem, describe the dataset you plan to use, and specify the machine learning algorithms you intend to explore."
